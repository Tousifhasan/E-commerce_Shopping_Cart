# E-commerce_Shopping_Cart
This project is an interactive web application that allows users to simulate shopping by selecting products, specifying quantities, and calculating the total cost. Here are the key features:

Product Selection: Users can add items to their virtual shopping cart, just like in a real store.

Cost Calculation: The application takes input for the number of products and their individual costs (in dollars). It then calculates the subtotal.

VAT (Value Added Tax): A 10% VAT is applied to the subtotal, reflecting the tax component.

Grand Total: Finally, the application displays the grand total, including both the subtotal and VAT.
